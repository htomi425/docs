Many users out there are looking for a viable resource to use Linux system on their Android devices without rooting their devices. AndroNix is a viable option for these purposes but with some limitations. We make our best efforts to provide a full Linux PC üíªexperience to our users but some things are just out of our hand due to certain restrictions imposed by the Android layer, its SELinux üîê policies and the process we use to run the Linux on the Android devices.

On this page you can find the summary of what AndroNix is not capable of doing with the reasons. So here is the list:

* AndroNix is not capable of running **STEAM üéÆ,** any PC games or emulate architecure using Wine/PlayonLinux on any of its Linux systems. The main reason for this is because Steam is only made for Intel/AMD based CPU's and not mobile based CPU's i.e. aarch64, armv8, arm64, arm, armv7, arm32 etc.
* AndroNix is not capable of running any software except software complied for **arm64/armv8/aarch64** architecture if you are using any **Android device** based of **Android 7** or above and has **arm64/armv8/aarch64** chipset. You can check your device architecture by using [**CPUZ**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cpuid.cpu_z). If you are using any device which has Android layer such as **Chromebook** then AndroNix will only be able to run software made for your architecture which may be **i386/i686/x86 or x86\_64.** 

\*\*\*\*

* AndroNix does not claim that it will run all the software even if the software complies to all the conditions mentioned in the above point. If the software is made in such a way that it requires the presence of Linux Kernel or any hardware support which is not present in the ‚ö† **PRoot environment** then the software might fail to run**.** AndroNix uses PRoot environment which has certain inevitable limitations leading to unusable software.
* AndroNix is not made for compiling large chunks of code üë©üíªsuch as building an Android app, any software or compiling kernels. Code compilations sometimes require specific hardware which is not present in PRoot environment which may lead to errors while compiling code. Any such reports on any support channel will not be entertained. 
* Linux environments made available by AndroNix cannot be used for **hacking/cracking purposes** i.e. Wi-Fi hacking, packet capture etc. All these things require real hardware which supports all the features like packet capturing which is not available natively in Android phones. 
* Linux environments cannot mount/read any hardware such as drives or adapters üñ®. This is because fuse mount cannot be used under PRoot.
* Any Linux OS cannot be installed on External Storage as Android does not give permission to write on External storage such as sdcard or USB devices. 
* **SNAP/Docker/Flatpak** packages cannot be installed on any Linux environment. It is mainly due to two reasons. Primary being that both require kernel and bus modeules which are unavailable in PRoot environment and second being that both are mainly focused on Intel/AMD based architectures and not for arm architecture.
* You can't use any serivce such as VPN or anything which changes the properties of network cause the network used within Linux container is managed by Android and not Linux itself and hence it does not have access to modify any property of the network.
* Any available distro is **not Hardware Accelerated**. Its because Termux doesn't have hardware acceleration support. The day termux adds hardware acceleration to their app we will support it too.
