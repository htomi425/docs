We have only tested **VS code**, **IntelliJ Idea**, **IntelliJ DataGrip**, **MonoDevelop** \(tested GTKsharp, ASP NET, ASP NETCORE this last have a problem with the target framework\), **Mono** \(In console, you can compile simple console programs in C \#\) **Net Core**.

You can look at our post on how to install IntelliJ Idea here

{% page-ref page="intellij-idea.md" %}

Just follow the same procedure and **rename the tar.gz and folder** to the IDE that you're downloading. Just start the IDE with navigating to the **bin** folder of the extracted tar and finding a shell file with the name of the IDE. Execute it with -

```text
./<IDE-name>.sh
```
