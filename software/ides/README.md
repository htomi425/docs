# IDEs

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ide_banner.png)

We love to code here and Andronix is a portable computer. Why not use it to code anywhere? You can use full fledged IDEs inside Andronix.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We have only tested **VS code**, **IntelliJ Idea**, **IntelliJ DataGrip**, **MonoDevelop** \(tested GTKsharp, ASP NET, ASP NETCORE this last have a problem with the target framework\), **Mono** \(In console, you can compile simple console programs in C \#\) **Net Core**. You can test other IDEs and edit this page to add it to the list.
{% endhint %}
