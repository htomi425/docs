* The first three options will install Void with the mentioned [Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment). The **Non-DE** variant installs Void without any Desktop Environment and is recommended for using the distro only with a _Command Line Interface_. The last three options will install Void with the mentioned [Windows Manager](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager).

We recommend to choose **XFCE variant** as it is the most stable, smooth, advanced and customizable Desktop Environment present at the moment

### Exiting VNC

Exiting and stopping the VNC server gracefully is important to avoid any ghost process to be running and rendering the server almost useless. Read about how to exit the VNC server in this article.
