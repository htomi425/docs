* The first three options will install Fedora with the mentioned [Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment). The **Non-DE** variant installs Fedora without any Desktop Environment and is recommended for using the distro only with a _Command Line Interface_. The last three options will install Fedora with the mentioned [Windows Manager](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager).

{% hint style="success" %}
We recommend to choose **XFCE variant** as it is the most stable, smooth, advanced and customizable Desktop Environment present at the moment
